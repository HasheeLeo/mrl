# mrl (MyRPG Language)

This was my first serious C++ project ever. There's probably lots of stupid stuff going on in it as I was still relatively new to C++ back then, but it was a fun project nonetheless.

It was my attempt to create a scripting language for a game engine called MyRPG, which itself I was writing in BYOND's DM language (https://www.byond.com).

Only finished the Lexer part before realizing how complex designing a language can actually be if you don't know what you're doing. Maybe I'll finish it when I officially learn about Compiler Design in college.
